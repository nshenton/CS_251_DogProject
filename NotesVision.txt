Notes from image recognition lecture:

n = width
m = length
Color images composed of an n x m x 3 array for each pixel (r, g, b)

Recommended library for python: opencv

Easiest way is to us keras (python library on top of tensorflow)
Install tensorflow
Import tensorflow as tf
From tensorflow import keras

You must load your data from the hard drive into training images and training labels

Convert all data from the image (n x m pixels) into a single feature vector [0, ... , n x m]
Normalize rgb values by dividing by 255
